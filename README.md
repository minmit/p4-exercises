# P4 Assignment

This assignment will help you get familiar with some of the 
main concepts and constructs of the P4 programming language.

## Obtaining required software

To complete the exercises, you will need to either build a
virtual machine or install several dependencies.

To build the virtual machine:
- Install [Vagrant](https://vagrantup.com) and [VirtualBox](https://virtualbox.org)
- Clone the repository
- Before proceeding, ensure that your system has at least 12 Gbytes of free disk space, otherwise the installation can fail in unpredictable ways.
- `cd vm-ubuntu-20.04`
- `vagrant up` - The time for this step to complete depends upon your computer and Internet access speeds, but for example with a 2015 MacBook pro and 50 Mbps download speed, it took a little less than 20 minutes.  It requires a reliable Internet connection throughout the entire process.
- When the machine reboots, you should have a graphical desktop machine with the required software pre-installed.  There are two user accounts on the VM, `vagrant` (password `vagrant`) and `p4` (password `p4`).  The account `p4` is the one you are expected to use.

*Note*: Before running the `vagrant up` command, make sure you have enabled virtualization in your environment; otherwise you may get a "VT-x is disabled in the BIOS for both all CPU modes" error. Check [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33304393/vt-x-is-disabled-in-the-bios-for-both-all-cpu-modes-verr-vmx-msr-all-vmx-disabl) for enabling it in virtualbox and/or BIOS for different system configurations.

You will need the script to execute to completion before you can see the `p4` login on your virtual machine's GUI. In some cases, the `vagrant up` command brings up only the default `vagrant` login with the password `vagrant`. Dependencies may or may not have been installed for you to proceed with running P4 programs. Please refer the [existing issues](https://github.com/p4lang/tutorials/issues) to help fix your problem or create a new one if your specific problem isn't addressed there.

If you need to install dependencies by hand, please contact the instructor as soon as possible.

## Warm-up: Forwarding

In the [forwarding](./exercises/forwarding) folder, you will find an example of implementing destination-based IPv4 forwarding on a network topology that we will use in this assignment. You do not need to add anything to the code in this folder. Simply run the instructions in its [README file](./exercises/forwarding/README.md) to get familiar with the topology and the different pieces of software that work together to emulate and program the network.
 
## The Assignment: Filtering suspicious traffic

## P4 Documentation and Extra Resources

The documentation for P4_16 and P4Runtime is available [here](https://p4.org/specs/)

All excercises in this repository use the v1model architecture, the documentation for which is available at:
1. The BMv2 Simple Switch target document accessible [here](https://github.com/p4lang/behavioral-model/blob/master/docs/simple_switch.md) talks mainly about the v1model architecture.
2. The include file `v1model.p4` has extensive comments and can be accessed [here](https://github.com/p4lang/p4c/blob/master/p4include/v1model.p4).

There are also some slides from a P4 tutorial event and a P4 Cheat Sheet in the repository that you can feel free to refer to as your are completing the assignment.
